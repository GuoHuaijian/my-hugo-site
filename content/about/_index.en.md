## Hi, I'm Sloth

A **Java backend developer** working in the **cybersecurity industry**, focusing on designing and building enterprise-level backend systems.

I work mainly with **Java, Spring, SQL/Databases, Redis, and Linux**, and I enjoy building systems that are stable, maintainable, and easy to reason about.  
I also have long-term interest in data security and engineering practices.
